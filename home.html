The only expense that I incur with Internet classes is my server charge, which is about RM 62.50 per month. That means by taking Internet classes can save my money. 
	Moreover, internet classes save time and saving time is important to me. If given a choice I would take all of my classes through the Internet. Online classes have saved money and time. .</p>
